PUC Chile ACM’s Student Chapter
===============================

This site is available on [acm-uc.github.io][Site]


Development
-----------
The site can be served locally using _jekyll_. _jekyll_ can be obtained as a _ruby_ _gem_

### Branching
We develop on the _dev_ branch and publish directly to the master branch. This leaves the _dev_ branch history ’clean’.

### Pre-requisites
```zsh
pacman -S ruby #or your favourite package manager
gem install jekyll yajl-ruby compass
```

### Local deploy
```zsh
cd path/to/project
jekyll serve --watch #you may want to add --draft to help development
```
